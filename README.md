# Bootcamp Challenge Week Six - Server Side APIs Weather Dashboard using javascript

## Description

Purpose: to test my knowledge of javascript and Server Side APIs.

In this project i was given no starter code and therefore i completed this task from scratch. The task was to create html, css and javascript code that enables a user to search for weather data from around the world, by dynamically chaging the displayed content on a single html page and then storing previous searches to local storage for the ability to call back previous searches.

The page styling was inspired buy the supplied example.

During this project I learnt how to pull data from a server side api and process the received data into the required form. I also learnt the quirks ok combining asynconous codes with synconous code and why this should be avoided, to avoid functions return prematurely without the required data.

## User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```
