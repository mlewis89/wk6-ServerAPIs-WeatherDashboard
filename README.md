# Bootcamp Challenge Week Four - Web APIs Quiz using javascript

## Description

Purpose: to test my knowledge of javascript and Web APIs.

In this project i was given no starter code and therefore i completed this task from scratch. The task was to create html, css and javascript code that enables a user to complete a quiz on the java script language, by dynamically chaging the displayed content on a single html page and then storing scores to local storage for use on a second htlm page of high scores.

The main focus of the assignment was on the javascript and therefore the page styling was not a priority 

During this project I learnt how to pull data from a html form and how include audio elements, and activate them from javascript.
