# Bootcamp Challenge Week Four - Web APIs Quiz using javascript

## Description

Purpose: to test my knowledge of javascript and Web APIs.

In this project i was given no starter code and therefore i completed this task from scratch. The task was to create html, css and javascript code that enables a user to complete a quiz on the java script language, by dynamically chaging the displayed content on a single html page and then storing scores to local storage for use on a second htlm page of high scores.

The main focus of the assignment was on the javascript and therefore the page styling was not a priority 

During this project I learnt how to pull data from a html form and how include audio elements, and activate them from javascript.

## User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```
